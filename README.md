This is a hotel reservation web application.

The website allows for two types of authenticated users: Hotel Owners and Users. Hotel owners can create, edit, delete, and view their own hotels. Users may view all listed hotels and reserve a room. Users may then edit, delete, and view their reservations.

Server code is written in Python using Flask and SQLAlchemy, while front-end code uses Jinja2, HTML/CSS, and Boostrap.

Thanks to Corey M. Schafer's tutorials on using Flask.
